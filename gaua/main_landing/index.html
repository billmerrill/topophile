        Building a 3D model is very similar to using an online map.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the map to find an area.</li>
        <li>Select the area to see a preview of the topography.</li>
        <li>Play with elevation to make it look nice.</li>
        <li>Build a printable model.</li>
        <li>Choose a size for your model.</li>
        <li>Upload your model for printing.</li>
        <li>View your model on Shapeways, and order a print</li>
        <li>Receive your 3D model in the mail!</li>
    </ol>

        Topophile made by Bill Merrill made necessary by the beauty of the world around him.

        <o>
        I moved to the state of Washington in 2013 and fell in love with the 
        great variety of natural beauty literally in every direction around me.
        The most exciting for me were all the mountains: mountains on the skyline, hikes 
        in the mountains, barely learning to ski in them.  Wanting to do more
        with the mountains I explored datasets describing them and learned 
        a little about 3D modeling to make my first 3D print, of Mt. Rainier, in 
        May 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
        Topophile started as me making tools for myself, making it easier to 
        find geographies, perfect the bounds of models, and visulize them before
        sending them to be printed.  As I saw the potential in my work, I decided 
        to make a tool to share with as many people as possible.  I look forward to
        the success of this first modeler and hope to explore more landscapes, datasets,
        and worlds 
        </p>
        <p>
        I hope you give this first model builder a try and let me know what you think.  
        I've love to see your models, to hear about your expeirences, and hear about
        ideas for other data make handheld.
