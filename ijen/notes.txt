how to make a state 

1. generate a mask for the state.  
    - on value is inside the state boundary.
    - each mask will require decision and joining for multiple parts and islands
2. generate an raw rectangular elevation source for the state
    - this is the boudning box for the state record
3. generate a VRML IndexedFaceSet for the elevation and base
    - AND the mask and the elevation source
4. generate a wrapping polygon from the outer edge of the mesh.
5. generate a wrapping IndexFaceSet or Sets for the exterior walls
