Projecting Dataset as it is served.

Iâ€™m trying to create a mapfile + WCS request that will reproject SRTM raster from epgs:4236 to epgs:3587.

I currently have configured a mapserver WCS to vend SRTM G1 data, and have a web app utilizing the WCS.  The web app resamples and reprojects the map data from epgs4236 to epgs3857 using gdal, I like to try having mapserver do this work instead.
